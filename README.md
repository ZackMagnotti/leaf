# leaf

A fun toy for creating family trees of cannabis strains!

Should work in most anaconda environments.

To run, navigate to this folder and run:

```
python3 main.py
```



Note:
    - The folder named `anytree` contains code that I stole from the `anytree` python module by `c0fec0de` on github.
